## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This app simulates a real-world backend system for a streaming platform, demonstrating your ability to:

- Architect scalable and maintainable APIs
- Handle sensitive user data securely
- Optimize performance with caching and efficient queries
- Collaborate effectively with frontend teams
- Apply backend engineering principles in a production-like environment

---

## 🧱 What the Backend Is Building

### 1. **User Management System**
- Handles user registration, login, and authentication using JWT
- Stores user profiles securely with hashed passwords
- Manages user sessions and access control

### 2. **Movie Catalog API**
- CRUD operations for movies, genres, and tags
- Endpoints to browse, search, and filter movies by genre, popularity, and release date
- Admin access to manage movie data via Django Admin

### 3. **User Interaction Tracking**
- Stores user ratings for movies (1–5 stars or similar)
- Tracks watch history and favorite movies
- These interactions feed into the recommendation logic

### 4. **Recommendation Engine**
- Suggests movies based on:
  - Genre preferences
  - Popularity trends
  - User rating patterns
- Can be extended to collaborative filtering or content-based algorithms

### 5. **Optimized Data Layer**
- Normalized relational database schema using Django ORM
- Efficient queries for filtering, sorting, and aggregating movie data
- Redis caching for high-traffic endpoints (e.g., trending movies)

### 6. **RESTful API Interface**
- Clean, versioned endpoints for frontend consumption
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting support
- Swagger or Postman documentation for easy integration

### 7. **Deployment & Hosting**
- Dockerized backend for portability
- Hosted on Railway or Render with CI/CD pipelines
- Environment variables and secrets managed securely
