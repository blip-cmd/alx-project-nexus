# 🎬 ALX Project Nexus Documentation

Welcome to my documentation hub for the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. This repository, `alx-project-nexus`, consolidates my major learnings and showcases the backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices I’ve applied throughout the program—culminating in the development of a full-featured **Movie Recommendation App**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document key backend technologies and concepts learned during the program
- Share real-world challenges and solutions encountered during development
- Highlight industry best practices and personal takeaways
- Foster collaboration between backend and frontend learners

---

## 📚 Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is a rigorous, hands-on curriculum designed to prepare learners for professional backend development roles. Through milestone projects and collaborative challenges, I’ve built a strong foundation in scalable backend systems and modern development workflows.

---

## 🛠️ Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** – Core programming language for backend logic
- **Django** – High-level web framework for rapid API development
- **Django REST Framework** – Building RESTful APIs with serializers and viewsets
- **GraphQL** – Schema-based querying for flexible data access
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent deployment environments
- **CI/CD** – Automated testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions

---

## 🧠 Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design** – ERD modeling, normalization, indexing, and relational integrity
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Task queues with Celery and RabbitMQ
- **Caching Strategies** – Redis integration for performance optimization
- **Authentication & Authorization** – JWT-based secure login and access control
- **API Documentation** – Swagger/OpenAPI for endpoint clarity
- **Deployment** – Hosting with Docker on Railway or Render

## 🎥 Capstone Project: Movie Recommendation App

This application allows users to:
- Browse and search movies by genre, popularity, and release date
- Rate and favorite movies
- Receive personalized recommendations based on viewing history and preferences
- Authenticate securely and manage their profiles

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, following RESTful principles and industry best practices.

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

- **Challenge**: Designing a flexible schema for user preferences and ratings  
	**Solution**: Created normalized models with many-to-many relationships and indexed queries for performance.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring fast response times for popular endpoints  
	**Solution**: Integrated Redis to cache frequently accessed movie data.

- **Challenge**: Building a scalable recommendation engine  
	**Solution**: Started with genre-based filtering and laid groundwork for collaborative filtering using user ratings.

- **Challenge**: Syncing with frontend collaborators  
	**Solution**: Shared API specs early via Discord and used Postman collections for testing.

## ✅ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write modular, readable, and well-documented code
- Use Git strategically: branches, commits, pull requests
- Prioritize API clarity and consistency
- Secure authentication flows with token-based access
- Embrace CI/CD for professional-grade workflows
- Collaborate early and often—communication is key
